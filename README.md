# Project_3
This project provides rudimentary code to analyze a list of grocery items purchased daily. The program: 
  1.	creates a sorted list with quantities purchased
  2.	allows the user to get the quantity sold for a single item
  3.	creates a text-base histogram

It is written in C++ and calls a python file that provides data manipulation and analysis functionality. Using C++ allowed me to write secure code by relying on the tenants of Object-Oriented Programming like encapsulation. This code is well suited for ordering and counting items in a text document as it uses Python, which is well suited for handling large data sets. A library like mathplotlib would create more appealing plots to improve the histogram using Python. However, my initial attempts to include a polt using this library proved too challenging to implement in the given timeframe. There was a lot of collaboration and support from the StackOverflow community, and I will add it to my coding toolbox. Additionally, myriad web pages cover most aspects of C++, with authors generously sharing their tips and tricks. This program uses comments and segments code into logical functions to create easily maintainable code.
